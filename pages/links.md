I've long enjoyed blogs like [kottke](https://kottke.org/) and [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/) for consistently good link curation. I don't plan on posting _just_ links or with the same frequency as those examples (which are usually multiple links daily), but using this space for similar purposes.
