# A Little About Me

## The Work Stuff

I've worked as a software engineer for about a decade, primary in web development. While I'm capable poking around the whole stack, I'm most comfortable in the front end. I like to think about and appreciate the little details of software, while still balancing the bigger picture.

After starting out my career in a few SaaS companies, a desire for something more mission-driven work ultimately led me into civic tech, first with a [vendor](https://adhoc.team/) and now [within government](https://innovation.nj.gov/). My guiding philosophies are:

- **Starting with why before what.** Technology is rarely a solution in and of itself, just an enabler. A well-defined and well-explored problem begets a better solution. Start with goals and desired outcomes and work backwards from there.
- **Keeping things as simple as you can reasonably achieve.** Software engineering is all about managed complexity, i.e., complexity is typically inherent to the system. Code becomes tech debt the moment it's written.
- **Strive for small cross-functional teams that have a shared understanding of their purpose.**
